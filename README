This R project contains R code for recreating the analysis reported in 
"Long-Term Trends in Vegetation on Bureau of Land Management Rangelands in the 
Western United States" for publication in Rangeland Ecology and Management.  

The data required for these analysis come from a variety of public sources. The 
spatial data required for the analysis including the BLM allotment boundaries can 
be retrieved from the sources listed in Appendix A Table A1 in the online 
supporting materials.  BLM allotment boundaries were further processed in QGIS 
prior to analysis.  Please refer to the QGIS processing steps found in the
"code/build_db/QGIS_cleaning_steps.txt" file. A cleaned BLM allotment shapefile 
is available as an Earth Engine asset here (https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/andykleinhesselink/blm_allotments). 

The ownership, cover and production data are extracted using Google Earth Engine 
(https://earthengine.google.com/). Scripts required for extracting these data 
are available in the "code/Earth_Engine_Code" folder within this project. Once 
the ownership, cover and production data have been extracted on Google EE and 
downloaded to a local machine, the data can be processed in R by running the 
scripts found in the "code/build_db" folder. Refer to the "setup.R" script for 
more information.  

Once all the data has been processed run the analysis scripts found in the 
"code/analysis" folder. A step by step list of analysis scripts can be found in 
the "code/analysis/run_analysis.R" script.
